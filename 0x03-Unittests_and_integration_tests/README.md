# Unittests and Integration Tests

This project introduces unit testing and integration testing concepts in Python using the built-in `unittest` framework and additional tools such as `parameterized` and `mock`. The goal is to practice writing clean, isolated tests and validating expected behavior for small functions as well as multiple interacting components.
