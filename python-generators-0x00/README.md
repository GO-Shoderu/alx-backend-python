# Python Generators 

This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. 

## The Tasks
- Created some functions according to the prototypes provided and I imported data from .csv file to the database
- Created a couple of generators that streams rows from an SQL database one by one. (seed.py)
